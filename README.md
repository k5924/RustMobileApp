## About The Project

I have been recently learning rust and wanted to see if I could build a mobile app with some rust code. The code isn't in a working state as the tutorial I was following was released in 2019 and the APIs/libraries that were used before have been updated or are now deprecated. This project was supposed to work by using a mobile application framework like Kotlin, Swift, or Flutter to call rust functions to render content inside a mobile application.

## Built With



* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
* [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
* [Dart](https://dart.dev/)
